## Usage Notes

This dataset significantly advances electoral research by harmonizing data over time, mapping historical election results onto consistent 2021 municipal boundaries despite administrative changes. It unifies previously scattered and inconsistently reported election data into a centralized, standardized format, overcoming past accessibility challenges. By addressing previous data gaps at the municipal level in Germany, it provides the most complete and harmonized election dataset available. Additionally, the dataset enables dynamic analysis across multiple election years, allowing researchers to study trends, changes in voting patterns, and the impacts of economic shocks over time.

Researchers are encouraged to use the harmonized datasets for longitudinal studies and the unharmonized datasets for cross-sectional analyses. When analyzing smaller municipalities or comparing across states, be aware of differences in electoral rules and reporting practices.

## Applications

The dataset supports a wide range of research topics, including:

1. **Nationalization of Politics**: Study how voting behavior aligns across local, state, and federal levels.
2. **Economic Voting**: Analyze how local economic conditions influence voting patterns at different levels of government.

## Code Availability

The code used to generate the datasets and perform the analyses is available in the `code` folder of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/awiedem/german_election_data). Additional details and instructions are provided in the scripts.
