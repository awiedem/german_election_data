`federal_muni_harm` is a previous version of the harmonized municipality level federal elections dataset. These data files do not contain the recent 2025 federal election. Municipalities are harmonized to 2021 municipality boundaries.

We recommend working instead with the updated datasets `federal_muni_harm_21` or `federal_muni_harm_25`. The suffix indicates which municipality boundaries are used for creating a balanced panel of municipalities.
